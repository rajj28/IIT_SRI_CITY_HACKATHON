# 3D IMAGE SEGMENTATION FOR BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION


ðŸš€ Project Overview

Brain tumor resection requires precise planning to minimize damage to healthy tissue. This project leverages deep learning (U-Net) for brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans and reconstructs a 3D visualization to assist neurosurgeons in planning tumor removal procedures effectively.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

AI-driven Segmentation: Automated tumor detection from MRI scans using a U-Net model.

3D Tumor Visualization: Converts segmented data into a 3D model for better spatial understanding.

Multi-class Segmentation: Identifies necrotic core, edema, and enhancing tumor regions.

Feasibility & Scalability: Works with real-world MRI datasets and can be expanded to other tumor types.

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Traditional tumor segmentation is manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. This project automates the process using deep learning & generative AI, enhancing precision and reducing surgical risks.

ðŸ”¬ Technologies Used

Deep Learning: TensorFlow & Keras (U-Net for segmentation)

Medical Imaging: NIfTI format MRI scans (BraTS dataset)

3D Visualization: Vedo, Matplotlib, and PyVista

Data Processing: NumPy, OpenCV, and SimpleITK

Deployment: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
